This is a sample project that I put together, which allowed me to:

1. learn angularJS
2. Refresh my data structures and algorithms knowledge.

To Run: You can either copy the algorithms folder to the htdocs folder of your favorite HTTP server 
		or if you have python installed, you can use this command:  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
